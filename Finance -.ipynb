The 30-share Sensex was down as much as 634 points at 35,341.68 while the 50-share Nifty tumbled over 150 points to 10,663.65.As many as 41 stocks on the Nifty were in the red, with Eicher Motors, Reliance Industries, Tech Mahindra, TCS and GAIL falling 2-5 per cent. On the other hand, Larsen & Toubro, Hindalco, Bharti Infratel, Tata Steel and Wipro advanced 0.50-4 per cent.Mood was decidedly cautious ahead of the RBI policy meeting decision tomorrow.What dampened market sentiment? Here are five factors.Rupee at record low: A falling rupee weighed heavy on investor sentiment. The local currency plunged to its fresh record low of 73.77 against the dollar early Thursday. The Indian unit on Wednesday crashed below the 73 mark against the dollar for the first time ever. The dollar index stood tall against other currencies, boosted by a spike in Treasury yields following upbeat US data and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that were seen as hawkish.“Dollar dominated the last 24 hours as the rupee collapsed to a fresh all-time low on spot. Policymakers tried everything, monetary intervention, and verbal steroids and even tried to circulate rumours about an \"oil window\". Nothing worked. The RBI added fuel to fire by denying any attempts to introduce special dollar window for the oil marketing companies. Oil was on the boil, local equity and bond markets were under the hammer. If that was not enough, rising Italian credit spreads whacked the euro, further pressuring the rupee,” Kotak Securities said in a report.Boiling oil: Brent crude was trading over $86 per barrel in morning deals while WTI crude was above $76 per barrel. Sajal Gupta, Head Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities, said, “Market has not reacted positively to steps taken by the government for stability in the rupee as they were perhaps not strong enough to address the key issue of short term demand. Most of the Asian and emerging currencies are calmer in past one month. Market is reacting strongly to Brent crude movements and with the current pace, 75 can likely be seen if crude touches 88-90 levels.”Rising bond yields: Hardening bond yields are creating waves of panic in the domestic equity market. India’s 10-year bond yield was hovering above 8.18 per cent on Thursday against previous close of 8.11 per cent. Bond yields have spiked 84 basis points on a year-to-date basis.Foreign capital outflows: Investors remained concerned over sustained foreign money outflows as foreign portfolio investors offloaded shares worth Rs 455.02 crore in October so far. They sold shares worth Rs 1,488.96 crore in September. However, their net investment stood at Rs 262.72 crore in August, as per data available with depository NSDL. According to the data released by the NSE, FIIs were net sellers of Rs 2,056.87 crore in index futures and options segments, according to Wednesday’s data. FIIs were net sellers of index futures to the tune of Rs 699.54 crore and net sellers of index options worth Rs 1357.33 crore.US Treasury yields reached multi-year peaks, with the 10-year note\\'s yield at its highest since 2014 and maturities at the short end of the curve at decade highs after economic data on Wednesday bolstered expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise rates in December and beyond.Weak Asian cues: Subdued Asian markets spoiled market sentiment too. Japan\\'s Nikkei edged lower in choppy trade on Thursday morning as investors took profit from its recent rally to a 27-year high while automakers and technology heavyweights took limelight on news of technology tie-ups for self-driving cars. Nikkei225 was trading 0.46 per cent down at 23,999 while Hang Seng came down over 1.50 per cent at 26,628.64.', 'highlightText': '', 'highlightTitle': '', 'language': 'english', 'external_links': [], 'entities': {'persons': [{'name': 'jerome powell', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'organizations': [{'name': 'wipro', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'eicher motors', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'tcs', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'tech mahindra', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'larsen & toubro', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'reliance industries', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'federal reserve', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'tata steel', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'gail', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'treasury', 'sentiment': 'none'}, {'name': 'bharti infratel', 'sentiment': 'none'}], 'locations': [{'name': 'us', 'sentiment': 'none'}]}, 'rating': None, 'crawled': '2018-10-04T09:43:34.003+03:00'}\n",

Markets fell with above average volumes, suggesting selling by institutional players mainly in hitherto stronger shares including IT services, Reliance Inds, some private Banks and insurance companies. Traders seemed to have taken cues from the technical breach and build short positions in select counters.\"\\n\"Key issues concerning the markets include the direction of the Rupee which is the past month’s worst performing emerging market currency having fallen to a new record low of 73.90 earlier in the session. On Thursday however the Rupee showed some signs of stability in the first half the session. Market participants are pinning their hope on the Reserve Bank of India and government taking necessary measures to arrest the decline in the value of the Rupee.\"\\n\"Most Asian markets are down sharply in response to the spike in U.S. Treasury yields to levels unseen since 2011, which makes it challenging for other asset classes to attract buying. 10 Year yields in the US touched 3.17 on Wednesday and has inched up further on Thursday. Crude prices which have touched a 4 year high is another reason for concern for our markets as it affects the macros and then indirectly the growth rate of the economy. Trade war situation seems to be escalating lately which could impact global trade and its consequent effect on the Indian economy.\"\\n\"The Govt has been proactive and trying to tackle the situation keeping fiscal discipline in mind. Timely apt decisions (a series of them) from the Govt/RBI could help in turning around the sentiments in the bond and equity markets even as one hopes that the global situation does not worsen much in the near term.

      "Reliance Industries and Eicher Motors were the biggest losers among Nifty50 stocks, sinking 6.5 percent each. Gross direct tax collection in the first six months of the financial year grew 16.7 percent to Rs 5.47 lakh crore, Finance Ministry said Thursday.\n",
      "Refunds amounting to Rs 1.03 lakh crore have been issued during April 2018 to September 2018, which is 30.4 per cent higher than refunds issued during the same period in the preceding year. Net collections (after adjusting for refunds) have increased by 14 per cent to Rs 4.44 lakh crore during April, 2018 to September, 2018. Oil traders have piled into wagers that US crude oil could surge to $100 a barrel by next year, a milestone that until recently many considered unthinkable due to record US production growth and relatively flat global demand. But the imminent return of US sanctions on Iran and bottlenecks keeping US oil from getting to market have fueled a rally that has taken benchmark oil prices to four-year highs. While big producing nations say supply is ample, hedge funds and speculators are increasingly skeptical of that argument, betting the market could rally further as sanctions on Iran's crude exports return on November 4. International Finance Corporation (IFC) moved an insolvency plea against infrastructure firm Punj Lloyd before the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT). A two-member principal bench headed by President Justice M M Kumar has issued notices to Punj Lloyd and Punj Lloyd Upstream Ltd. The tribunal has directed both the petitions to list on October 9, when it would hear similar matter in which leading private sector lender ICICI Bank has filed insolvency plea against Punj Lloyd. IFC is seeking recovery of USD 30 million defaulted by Punj Lloyd. Earlier in June, ICICI Bank had approached NCLT to recover Rs 830 crore of outstanding loans to Punj Lloyd. However, majority of its lender including SBI are against and had opposed ICICI's insolvency plea. Ramkrishna Forgings said the meeting of the board of directors is scheduled on November 3 to consider unaudited standalone financial results for the quarter and six months ended September 2018. Nelco said its subsidiary Tatanet Services and India’s fastest growing VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) service provider, has successfully established satellite based connectivity solution in collaboration with Vistara, India’s full service carrier, for connecting the airline’s airport setup in Leh, Ladakh. The lack of a stable connectivity in Leh impacts enterprise business applications significantly, affecting customer experience and impairing smooth functioning of the overall business. A reliable connection is imperative as it enables to scale bandwidth as and when required to provide a seamless experience. Reliance Industries and Eicher Motors were the biggest losers among Nifty50 stocks, sinking 6.5 percent each. HDFC Bank, TCS, Infosys, HDFC, ITC, Bajaj Finance, HUL, ICICI Bank, Bajaj Finserv and IndusInd Bank were down 1-4 percent while L&T, Bharti Infratel and Yes Bank gained more than 1 percent. IDBI Bank has allotted 33,98,97,328 equity shares to Life Insurance Corporation of India at a price of Rs 61.73 per share aggregating upto Rs 2,098.19 crore through preferential issue. Mindtree said the meeting of the board of directors of the company will be held on October 17, 2018, to consider the audited financial results for the quarter and half year ended September 2018 and also to consider the declaration of interim dividend, if any, amongst other matters. The midcap IT company has fixed record date as October 26 for payment of dividend, if approved. The company will also hold earnings call for Investors /Analysts on October 17 to discuss the financial results for the quarter ended September 2018. Ajay Srivastava of Dimensions Corporate Financial Services told CNBC-TV18 that he has disappointed with auto sales data announced for September. After the crude hit four-year high and rupee touched record low, he said he is relooking at growth estimates. \"We don't think India will grow at 6.7-7 percent in real terms.\" The Sensex corrected more than 3,500 points from its record high due to macro factors. He said he is not looking at buying stocks right now but technology stocks are in the best place right now given US exposure as in current rupee fall, exporters will be beneficial. Margin call and profit booking has been leading to further fall in midcaps, he feels. Tata Consultancy Services and Institute of Industrial Science, The University of Tokyo (liS, UTokyo), one of Japan's leading research institutes for engineering disciplines, have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to collaborate on technology research and facilitate interpersonnel exchange. Bears are not loosening their grip on Dalal Street as the benchmark indices remained under heavy selling pressure on macro factors like weakening rupee and rising crude oil prices. The 30-share BSE Sensex fell 632.82 points or 1.76 percent to 35,342.81 and the 50-share NSE Nifty slipped 198.40 points or 1.83 percent to 10,659.90. About three shares declined for every share rising on the BSE. Telecom Disputes Settlement & Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) granted relief to the company. Spectrum trading to be completed without bank guarantee of Rs 2,900 crore and company to receive Rs 975 crore from sale of spectrum. Company to pay Ericsson Rs 550 crore and RITL minority investors Rs 230 crore from spectrum trading. Gold prices fell by 0.07 percent to Rs 31,340 per ten gram in futures trading Thursday as participants trimmed their positions to book profit amid a weak trend overseas, reported PTI. At the Multi Commodity Exchange, gold for delivery in far-month December declined by Rs 23, or 0.07 percent to Rs 31,340 per ten gram in a business turnover of 361 lots. Jindal Steel and Power (JSPL) said it has posted its highest ever domestic quarterly steel production and sales in Q2 FY19. \"The company recorded a crude steel production of 1.3 MT (million tonne) and robust sales of 1.27 MT during the quarter July-September 2018.\" Its quarterly steel production saw a 46 percent growth during the quarter, while the quarterly steel sales traced a steeper curve by recording a rise of 53 percent on a year-on-year basis. The quarterly production and sales in Q2 of previous fiscal stood at 0.89 MT and 0.83 MT respectively. “The superlative production and sales performance is a result of the recently commissioned 3.25 MTPA Basic Oxygen Furnace (BOF) at JSPL’s 6 MTPA integrated steel plant at Angul, Odisha,\" NA Ansari, CEO – JSPL said. \"Steel production and sales are generally lower during Q2 due to the monsoons. We are looking at enhancing the growth curve during Q3 and Q4 in order to set new records during this fiscal,\" he added. IL&FS Transportation Networks said interest due and payable on September 30, 2018 on NCDs has been made to the debenture holders. Eicher Motors' key officials will be meeting Wellington Management today, and Steadview Capital Management, Ask Investment Managers and Columbia Threadneedle on October 5. India’s service sector continued to expand during September, but at a marginal rate amid reports of underwhelming market demand. Price pressures intensified, with higher fuel costs and a stronger US dollar raising the price of imported goods. Expectations remained in positive territory, whilst firms added to their staffing levels for a thirteenth successive month as part of efforts to keep on top of workloads. The seasonally adjusted Nikkei India Services Business Activity Index recorded 50.9 during September. That was down from 51.5 in August and the lowest reading in the current four-month sequence of rising activity. Weaker growth in the service sector was closely linked by panellists to a broad stagnation of new business. Companies reported that market conditions were underwhelming amid a lack of demand at a time of generally higher prices, reports Nikkei IHS Markit. Bears further tightened their grip on Dalal Street as the 30-share BSE Sensex plunged 652.03 points or 1.81 percent to 35,323.60 as investors worried about trade deficit due to consistent rise in crude oil prices and fall in rupee. The 50-share NSE Nifty slipped 200.30 points or 1.84 percent to 10,658. About three shares declined for every share rising on the BSE. Inderjeet Bhatia of Macquarie said meetings with North American investors suggest a lack of confidence in the near term due to macro headwinds. \"Reduction in US-China rhetoric could lead to another round of underperformance.\" The research house recommended switching from expensive defensives in India to cheaper cyclical names, he said. Macquarie has a positive outlook on IT, industrials, autos, cement and real estate; while it is negative on consumer, pharma and NBFCs. It has a neutral stance on private banks, energy, metals, media and utilities.

      "The benchmark Sensex lost more than 600 points during the early trading session on Thursday as concerns escalated over riding crude prices and a depreciating rupee, which hit a new low on Thursday.\n",
      "At 11:15, the 30-share Sensex was trading at 35,382, down 593 points. The broader Nifty was at 10,661.40, down 197 points or 1.81%.\n",

      "Sensex crashes 600 points: Factors behind this mayhem\n",
      "Domestic stock markets crashed big time early today as benchmark indices fell more than 1.50 per cent. The 30-share Sensex was down as much as 634 points at 35,341.68 while the 50-share Nifty tumbled over 150 points to 10,663.65.As many as 41 stocks on the Nifty were in the red, with Eicher Motors, Reliance Industries, Tech Mahindra, TCS and GAIL falling 2-5 per cent. On the other hand, Larsen & Toubro, Hindalco, Bharti Infratel, Tata Steel and Wipro advanced 0.50-4 per cent.Mood was decidedly cautious ahead of the RBI policy meeting decision tomorrow.What dampened market sentiment? Here are five factors.Rupee at record low: A falling rupee weighed heavy on investor sentiment. The local currency plunged to its fresh record low of 73.77 against the dollar early Thursday. The Indian unit on Wednesday crashed below the 73 mark against the dollar for the first time ever. The dollar index stood tall against other currencies, boosted by a spike in Treasury yields following upbeat US data and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that were seen as hawkish.“Dollar dominated the last 24 hours as the rupee collapsed to a fresh all-time low on spot. Policymakers tried everything, monetary intervention, and verbal steroids and even tried to circulate rumours about an \"oil window\". Nothing worked. The RBI added fuel to fire by denying any attempts to introduce special dollar window for the oil marketing companies. Oil was on the boil, local equity and bond markets were under the hammer. If that was not enough, rising Italian credit spreads whacked the euro, further pressuring the rupee,” Kotak Securities said in a report.Boiling oil: Brent crude was trading over $86 per barrel in morning deals while WTI crude was above $76 per barrel. Sajal Gupta, Head Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities, said, “Market has not reacted positively to steps taken by the government for stability in the rupee as they were perhaps not strong enough to address the key issue of short term demand. Most of the Asian and emerging currencies are calmer in past one month. Market is reacting strongly to Brent crude movements and with the current pace, 75 can likely be seen if crude touches 88-90 levels.”Rising bond yields: Hardening bond yields are creating waves of panic in the domestic equity market. India’s 10-year bond yield was hovering above 8.18 per cent on Thursday against previous close of 8.11 per cent. Bond yields have spiked 84 basis points on a year-to-date basis.Foreign capital outflows: Investors remained concerned over sustained foreign money outflows as foreign portfolio investors offloaded shares worth Rs 455.02 crore in October so far. They sold shares worth Rs 1,488.96 crore in September. However, their net investment stood at Rs 262.72 crore in August, as per data available with depository NSDL. According to the data released by the NSE, FIIs were net sellers of Rs 2,056.87 crore in index futures and options segments, according to Wednesday’s data. FIIs were net sellers of index futures to the tune of Rs 699.54 crore and net sellers of index options worth Rs 1357.33 crore.US Treasury yields reached multi-year peaks, with the 10-year note's yield at its highest since 2014 and maturities at the short end of the curve at decade highs after economic data on Wednesday bolstered expectations for the Federal Reserve to raise rates in December and beyond.Weak Asian cues: Subdued Asian markets spoiled market sentiment too. Japan's Nikkei edged lower in choppy trade on Thursday morning as investors took profit from its recent rally to a 27-year high while automakers and technology heavyweights took limelight on news of technology tie-ups for self-driving cars. Nikkei225 was trading 0.46 per cent down at 23,999 while Hang Seng came down over 1.50 per cent at 26,628.64.\n",

      "Fear takes hold on markets, Sensex crashes over 500 points\n",
      "NEW DELHI: Indian equity benchmarks Sensex and Nifty opened with major losses on Thursday amid rupee's fresh fall against the US currency and weakness in other Asian markets.Rupee's poor health, surging crude oil prices and firming US bond yields weighed on market sentiment.Investors avoided riskier equities and turned to safe bets, including gold and treasury bonds.The rupee hit a fresh record low of 73.77 against the American currency in early trade on Thursday after the dollar index stood tall, boosted by a spike in Treasury yields following upbeat US data and comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that were seen as hawkish.Higher US yields are anything but favourable for emerging markets, however, as they tend to draw away much-needed foreign funds while pressuring local currencies, Reuters reported. Around 9:20 am, the Sensex was 442 points, or 1.23 per cent down at 35,533.69, while the Nifty was 115 points, or 1.06 per cent, down at 10,743.05.In the 30-share Sensex index, only three stocks- Larsen & Toubro, Vedanta and ONGC - were trading with gains. Rest fell up to 3 per cent. The Nifty index had four components - Larsen & Toubro, Hindalco, Bharti Infratel and Vedanta - trading in the green zone.Reliance industries, Hero MotoCorp, Bharti Airtel, TCS and HDFC were the top losers in the Sensex basket of stocks at that time.Barring capital goods, industrilas and metal, all sectoral indices were in the red on BSE at that time. BSE Energy and realty cracked over 2 per cent, with most components incurring losses. Broader midcaps and smallcaps were in line with Sensex. The BSE Midcap and Smallcap indices fell up to 1.15 per cent in the early trade.\n",

      "For months analysts have been screaming that the record rally in the markets have been on the back of a rally in the share price of HDFC twins, Reliance, TCS and Infosys.\n",
      "On Tuesday something interesting happened. The major contribution to the dramatic fall in the Nifty came from TCS shares , which slumped 4.5 per cent. Today, as we write Reliance Industries another heavyweight has fallen 4.4 per cent, and the biggest contributor to the Nifty fall.\n",
      "The broader markets have seen such damage, that sanity is prevailing with investors now dumping heavyweights that have risen sharply in favour of some of the laggards. We are seeing buying in beaten down names like Yes Bank , DHFL, L&T Finance Holdings, PC Jeweller , PNB, Indiabulls Real Estate etc.\n",
      "In fact, Punjab National Bank is now seeing good buying support and is among the names that are trading higher today despite a crack in the Sensex of 600 points.\n",
      "An interesting churn taking place\n",
      "For long investors took shelter in TCS, Infoys, HDFC Bank and HDFC and mostly dumped all other stocks. The tide now seems to be turning. Today, TCS is down 3.5 per cent and Reliance 4.5 per cent, dragging the indices lower, while several beaten down names are rising.\n",
      "India Bulls Real Estate, which has fallen from levels of 240 to Rs 90 is among the gainers today. It was up 7 per cent on Tuesday, a day on which the Nifty declined 150 points.\n",
      "Companies like PC Jeweller, which has fallen from levels of Rs 600 to Rs 55 was in the green today seeing buyers, despite the Nifty down 182 points.\n",
      "Interestingly, there seems to be some value buying happening in the other broader market, which was in the bear grip, which is a very good thing to happen. Finally we are seeing some sanity emerging in the broader markets, as investors dump heavyweight stocks in favour of beaten down names. This is a sigh of relief to investors who have seen the broader markets being pounded.\n",
      "Will the trend last? One cannot be sure, at least investors have begun chasing stocks that offer value. \n",

The Indian unit on Wednesday crashed below the 73 mark against the dollar for the first time ever.

Most of the Asian and emerging currencies are calmer in past one month. Market is reacting strongly to Brent crude movements and with the current pace, 75 can likely be seen if crude touches 88-90 levels.”\n",

      "Foreign capital outflows: Investors remained concerned over sustained foreign money outflows as foreign portfolio investors offloaded shares worth Rs 455.02 crore in October so far.

      "Mumbai: The BSE benchmark Sensex plunged over 550 points Wednesday to slip below the 36,000-mark on heavy selling in IT, auto and telecom stocks, after the rupee collapsed to a new life-time low amid surging crude oil prices. After a weak start, The BSE 30-share barometer plummeted below the 36,000-mark to hit a low of 35,911.82, finally settling 550.51 points, or 1.51 per cent, down at 35,975.63. The gauge had gained 299 points in the previous session Monday after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced measures to shore up liquidity. The NSE Nifty, too, stayed in the negative terrain through the session and hit a low of 10,843.75, finally ending 150.05 points, or 1.36 per cent, lower at 10,858.25. Market cracked as rupee hit a new low due to increase in oil prices and concern over balance of payment, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.“Despite government’s plan to cut borrowing in H2FY19, yields continued to increase due to rate hike expectation from RBI. Sentiment for equity has turned tepid given heightened volatility in the domestic and global financial markets,” he added. According to market analysts, the outcome of RBI monetary policy, which is scheduled Friday, will provide further direction to the markets. The three-day RBI policy review began Wednesday, and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to go for a 25 basis points hike. The rupee breached the 73-mark for the first time to hit an all-time low of 73.41 (intra-day) against the US dollar. Meanwhile, Brent crude oil near USD 85 a barrel.

      "Small dividend-paying companies are worth a look\n",
      "Investors dream big when looking for dividends. They love large stocks with generous yields. But big isn’t always better because small dividend payers have plenty to offer.\n",
      "To highlight the advantages of thinking small, it’s useful to look at past returns. A fortunate investor would have gained an average of 12.8 per cent annually by buying an equal amount of all-Canadian dividend stocks on the TSX with market capitalizations between $200-million and $2-billion over the 16 years through to the end of 2017.\n",
      "By way of comparison, a portfolio with an equal amount of the relatively large dividend paying stocks in the S&P/TSX Composite Index gained 10.2 per cent annually over the same 16 years. The index itself, which is a good proxy for the Canadian stock market, averaged an annual return of 7.5 per cent over the same period.\n",
      "(All of the returns herein include dividend reinvestment and do not include fund fees, taxes or other trading frictions. The dividend portfolios are rebalanced at the end of each year.)\n",
      "The gains for the small stocks were stellar, but the ride was painful at times. When the market crashed in 2008 the S&P/TSX Composite fell 33 per cent for the year. The portfolio of large dividend stocks cushioned investors with a slightly less painful 29-per-cent drop. The small dividend stocks suffered more with a decline of 35.1 per cent. While the small stocks generated big long-term returns, they came with harsh short-term drawdowns, which some investors would find hard to stomach.\n",
      "I investigated the small dividend payers in more detail by putting them through the Bloomberg back-tester. The small stocks, with a market capitalization between $200-million and $2-billion, were sorted by indicated dividend yield at the end of each year and put into five portfolios (called quintiles) containing an equal number of stocks. (The stocks were split into five groups rather than 10 because there were relatively few candidates to pick from in the early years.)\n",
      "The portfolios were tracked and the results shown in the accompanying chart, which highlights the annual performance advantage offered by each group against the market index over the 16 years to the end of 2017.\n",
      "For instance, the middle portfolio of medium-yielding stocks grew at a compound annual rate of 14.1 per cent and outperformed the S&P/TSX Composite Index by an average of 6.6 percentage points per year. Over the 16 years, an investment in it would have turned $100,000 into about $825,000, while an investment in the index would have grown the same amount to about $319,000.\n",
      "The portfolios with the most extreme yields still beat the market but fared poorly compared with those that have more moderate yields. The small stocks with the highest yields had the worst relative showing.\n",
      "Because I’m leery of stocks with extremely high dividend yields, I split the highest yield portfolio in half by yield. That is, I tracked one portfolio of stocks with the highest 10 per cent of yields (the top decile) and another portfolio that contained the next highest 10 per cent of yielding stocks. (Both contained just a handful of stocks in the early years.)\n",
      "The small stocks with extremely high yields (the top decile) gained an average of 7.4 per cent annually over the 16 years and lagged the market index slightly. The second-highest decile fared better with average annual returns of 13.5 per cent. Incidentally, the poor performance associated with giant dividend yields isn’t limited to small stocks; in a previous column I found this applies to large dividend stocks as well.\n",
      "Small dividend stocks deserve a spot in a well-diversified portfolio owing to their return potential. But treat them with caution and due consideration. Investors should be particularly careful when dealing with firms with extremely high yields.\n",
      "S&P/TSX dividend payers with a market cap between $200-million and $2-billion\n",

By: FE Bureau | Mumbai | Published: October 4, 2018 12:36 AM The Sensex fell by more than 500 points on at least one session in each of the preceding three weeks. (Reuters)\n",
      "The benchmark Sensex posted its biggest single-day drop in nearly seven months after a sharp sell-off across the sectors led by auto and IT pulled down the index to 35,975.63 – its lowest level since July 10. While the Sensex fell 550.51 points or 1.5% on Wednesday, the broader Nifty ended the session at 10,858.25 down 150.05 points or 1.4% from the previous close. The Sensex fell by more than 500 points on at least one session in each of the preceding three weeks, and the Index managed to end in the green only six sessions since the beginning of September.\n",
      "Software exporters like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and Wipro together contributed over 30% of Sensex fall on Wednesday, with TCS alone contributing 100.71 points to the index’s fall. Barring Nifty Metal, all the sectoral indices on NSE ended in the red on Wednesday, with Nifty Auto declining as much as 2.9%. This followed by Nifty IT, which slid 1.9%. In fact, the gauge for IT stocks has never seen similar losses ever since the rupee breached 70-mark against US dollar.\n",
      "The rupee lost another 43 paise on Wednesday to hit a record low of 73.34 against the dollar amid rising global crude oil prices and strong demand for the American currency from the importers. The Indian currency has given up close to 13% so far in 2018. At 10,858.25, the benchmark Nifty50 has given a negative return of 10.2% in dollar terms since January, while the S&P 500 has risen by 9.3% over the same period.\n",
      "While the index has gained 3.1% in rupee terms, this is thanks to the outperformance of just a handful of stocks. The broader market has under-performed, with the Nifty Midcap losing 19.2% and the Nifty Smallcap giving up close to 32% between January and now. What’s more, over 77% of all stocks with a market capitalisation of Rs 1,000 crore and above are trading in the red since the beginning of 2018. Moreover, nearly a half of these 743 stocks have lost more than a quarter of their value so far in 2018.\n",
      "The poor breadth of the market has probably kept FPIs away; so far in 2018, the overseas investors have pulled out Indian equities worth $2 billion.

      "\n",
      "The BSE benchmark Sensex plunged over 550 points today to slip below the 36,000-mark on heavy selling in IT, auto and telecom stocks, after the rupee collapsed to a new life-time low amid surging crude oil prices.\n",
      "After a weak start, The BSE 30-share barometer plummeted below the 36,000-mark to hit a low of 35,911.82, finally settling 550.51 points, or 1.51 per cent, down at 35,975.63. The gauge had gained 299 points in the previous session Monday after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) announced measures to shore up liquidity.\n",
      "The NSE Nifty, too, stayed in the negative terrain through the session and hit a low of 10,843.75, finally ending 150.05 points, or 1.36 per cent, lower at 10,858.25. Market cracked as rupee hit a new low due to increase in oil prices and concern over the balance of payment, said Vinod Nair, Head of Research, Geojit Financial Services.\n",
      "\"Despite government’s plan to cut borrowing in H2FY19, yields continued to increase due to rate hike expectation from RBI. Sentiment for equity has turned tepid given the heightened volatility in the domestic and global financial markets,\" he added.\n",
      "According to market analysts, the outcome of RBI monetary policy, which is scheduled Friday, will provide further direction to the markets. The three-day RBI policy review began Wednesday, and the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to go for a 25 basis points hike.\n",
      "The rupee breached the 73-mark for the first time to hit an all-time low of 73.41 (intra-day) against the US dollar. Meanwhile, Brent crude oil near $85 a barrel. In the Sensex pack, M&M was the biggest loser, tumbling by 6.66 per cent, followed by TCS dropping 4.14 per cent.\n",

      "Among sectoral indices, the BSE auto index emerged the worst performer by declining 2.90 per cent, followed by teck shedding 2.38 per cent, IT 2.23 per cent, bankex 1.54 per cent, FMCG 1.17 per cent, consumer durables 0.83 per cent, power 0.48 per cent and healthcare 0.38 per cent.\n",
      "While, metal, oil and gas, PSU and capital goods indices managed to end in the positive zone, rising up to 1.74 per cent. In the broader markets, the mid-cap index fell by 1.47 per cent, while small-cap index shed 0.40 per cent. Domestic markets were closed yesterday on account of Gandhi Jayanti.\n",
      "Meanwhile, foreign funds sold shares worth a net of Rs 1,842 crore, while domestic institutional investors bought equities worth Rs 1,805 crore Monday, provisional data showed. Mixed trend at other Asian and European markets on weak global cues also accelerated selling activity on bourses here, traders said.\n",
      "Asian stocks ended mixed with Hong Kong's Hang Seng falling 0.13 per cent, while Japan's Nikkei shedding 0.66 per cent. Taiwan Index too fell 0.51 per cent. In the Eurozone, Paris CAC rose 0.44 per cent, but Frankfurt's DAX was down 0.42 per cent in their late deals. London's FTSE up 0.38 per cent. Tags assigned to this article:\n",

      "Bears gradually tightened their grip on Dalal Street on Wednesday as the Sensex plunged more than 600 points intraday and the Nifty closed below 10,900 levels. Weakening rupee and rising crude oil prices raised possibility of another rate hike in Monetary Policy Committee's three-day meeting which began today.\n",
      "All sectoral indices ended in the red barring Metals that gained 1.8 percent. Bank, Auto, FMCG, IT and Financial Service indices were down between 1 percent and 3 percent.\n",

      "The Indian rupee breached 73/$ for the first time ever to hit a record low of 73.41/$ on strong demand for the American currency from importers amid rising global oil prices and unabated capital outflows. The fall in equity markets also hit sentiment. The currency recovered a bit from its lows but is still trading below 73 levels.\n",
      "\"While RBI's action stabilised liquidity conditions in the market, I reckon the RBI might let the currency go down further. With oil steaming up and more liquidity injection from the central bank will lead to some fall in rupee,\" Saurabh Mukherjea, Founder, Marcellus Investment Managers said.\n",
      "Brent crude futures, the international benchmark for oil prices, continued to hover around $85 a barrel, the highest level seen since November 2014 on rising expectations of supply concerns once US sanctions on Iranian oil come into effect from next month.\n",
      "The last-man-standing industries such as large cap autos and IT also started melting, almost leaving no place for markets to hide. Automobile stocks were battered as fears of margin compression came to fore.\n",

      "Sensex Plunges 550 Points As Rupee Hits Lifetime Low 0 Benchmark indices came crashing down in trade today, as the rupee hit a new lifetime low of 73.40 to the dollar. This was despite strong cues from across Europe and despite the Dow Jones hitting a new lifetime high. The Sensex ended the day 550 points lower at 35,975 points and the Nifty plunged 150 points to end at 10,858 points . The rupee was last seen at 73.23 to the dollar. Ironically, IT stocks, which should have rallied on account of a falling rupee, dropped, dragging the indices lower. Heavyweight, TCS was a big loser dropping as much as 4.35 per cent in trade. Mahindra and Mahindra lost 5 per cent, while another IT stock, Infosys was down 2.5 per cent in trade. Interestingly, government owned banking stocks were seeing decent buying support after the government stepped in to contain the IL&FS fiasco. Punjab National Bank was the top gainer from the space, rallying as much as 2 per cent on buying support. Yes Bank, which has seen a massive fall in the last few trading days, managed to gain in trade and was up a staggering 5 per cent. Another stock that was beaten down in the recent carnage, DHFL managed to trade higher. Shares in National Aluminium Company was a star performer in trade after reports that Norsk Hydro moved to shut its biggest alumina refinery in Brazil. Shares of NALCO ended the day higher by 11 per cent. Markets in India are expected to be volatile ahead of the RBI's Monetary Policy. A decision on interest rates would be taken by the RBI on Oct 5, in which it is widely expected that the central bank would hike interest rates by 0.25 per cent to curb the fall in the rupee.

      "Sensex Closes 550 Points Lower, Nifty Ends At 10,858\n",
      "COMMENTS A selloff witnessed across sectors barring metal stocks dragged the markets lower Stock markets finished Wednesday's session sharply lower, amid prevailing weakness in the rupee on soaring crude oil prices. BSE benchmark index Sensex declined 550 points - or 1.5 per cent - to close at 35,975, while the NSE Nifty settled 150 points lower at 10,858. Both the indices registered their lowest closing levels since July 9. A selloff witnessed across sectors barring metal stocks, dragged the markets lower while caution prevailed ahead of a key policy statement from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) due later this week. Here are 10 things to know: Mahindra & Mahindra, Eicher Motors, Bharti Infratel, TCS and Axis Bank - which settled between 4.4 per cent and 7 per cent lower - led the declined on the 50-scrip index Nifty. The rupee declined below the 73 mark against the US dollar for the first time ever, and registered a fresh all-time low of 73.42. Crude oil prices hovered above $85 a barrel near recent 2014 highs. That coupled with demand for the greenback hurt the forex market, say analysts. \"Crude at $85/barrel and rupee at 73 continue to be pressure points on the market,\" said Viral Berawala, CIO, Essel Mutual Fund. High crude oil prices along with weakness in the rupee tends to widen the current account deficit (CAD) , as the country meets more than 80 per cent of its oil demand through imports. The NSE's sectoral indices for banking, financial services, fast-moving consumer goods and IT finished the day around 1-2 per cent lower. \"More negativity and selling pressure is expected to continue in the markets going forward,\" AK Prabhakar, head of research at IDBI Capital, told NDTV. Mahindra & Mahindra shares were the top decliners on both the indices, closing 7 per cent lower on the NSE. The Nifty Auto - the NSE's sectoral index comprising automobile shares - dropped 2.9 per cent. M&M shares extended losses to a seventh consecutive session. Mahindra & Mahindra on Monday reported a 2 per cent year-on-year increase in total sales last month. The company said factors such as low consumer buying sentiment and high fuel prices led to muted growth in the passenger vehicle segment The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) began its three-day monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. In the central bank's statement due on Friday, analysts will keenly watch any move on key lending rates and further steps to support the currency. Analysts widely expect the central bank to hike the repo rate - the key interest rate at which the RBI lends short-term funds to commercial banks - by 0.25 per cent. \"The markets have priced in a 25-basis-point hike in the upcoming policy statement,\" Mr Prabhakar added.\n",

      "Auto stocks, both four-wheeler and two-wheeler space, will face some heat as growth numbers for NBFCs will come down as the lending activity is likely to take a back seat.\n",

      "Sensex falls 550 Points As Rupee Hits Lifetime Low Posted on by moneymaker Share benchmarks crashed on Wednesday, as the domestic currency hit a new lifetime low of 73.40 to the dollar, in spite of strong cues from across Europe. The BSE Sensex was down 550.51 points at 35,975.63 and the NSE Nifty50 plunged 150.05 points at 10,858.25. IT sector stocks, which should have rallied due to a falling rupee, plunged, dragging the indices lower. Mahindra and Mahindra was a big loser falling upto 7.03 percent in trade, while Hindalco lost 5 percent, while TCS was also fallen 4.38 percent, as major losers in the Nifity50 of NSE . On the other hand, Yes Bank, Hindalco, IndiaBulls, Hindustan Petrol and Vendata rallied upto 5.63 percent as top gainers in the index. Shares in NALCO has also made a stellar rally, rising upto 11.76 percent today after company unveils new business plan in Brazil. All sectoral indices on the NSE ended in the red, except Nifty Metal which plunged 1.81 percent. Meantime, Indian rupee inched towards its all-time low of 73.41 per U.S Dollar , at the time of this report. \n",

      "investor wealth: Dalal Street investors poorer by Rs 1.79 lakh crore as Sensex hits 3-month low\n",
      "New Delhi: As much as Rs 1.79 lakh crore wealth got wiped out on Wednesday, as market capitalisation of all the BSE-listed companies plunged to Rs 143.64 lakh crore from Rs 145.43 lakh crore.\n",
      "The BSE’s m-cap has now overall tanked by Rs 15.74 lakh crore since August 31.\n",
      "After taking a day’s weather on Monday, the benchmark equity indices again came under heavy selling pressure today on soaring crude oil prices and tumbling rupee.\n",
      "The 30-share Sensex settled 550.51 points or 1.51 per cent lower at 35,975.63. The 50-share Nifty dipped 150.05 points, or 1.36 per cent, to 10858.25.\n",
      "The rupee crashed below the 73-mark against the dollar for the first time ever in today’s trade on strong demand for the American currency from importers amid rising global oil prices and unabated capital outflows. Brent crude oil was hovering around $85 per barrel in the afternoon trade.\n",
      "“Market has not reacted positively to steps taken by the government for stability in the rupee, as they were perhaps not strong enough to address the key issue of short term demand. Most of the Asian and emerging currencies are calmer in past one month. Market is reacting strongly to brent crude movements and with current pace 75 can likely be seen if crude touches 88-90 levels,” said Sajal Gupta, Head Forex and Rates, Edelweiss Securities.\n",
      "As many as 36 stocks in Nifty ended in red with Mahindra & Mahindra falling 7.03 per cent, followed by Eicher Motors (down 6.79 per cent), Bharti Infratel (down 6.45 per cent), TCS (down 4.38 per cent) and Axis Bank (down 3.62 per cent).\n",
      "On the other hand, YES Bank, Hindalco, Indiabulls Housing Finance, HPCL and Vedanta gained between 3 per cent and 6 per cent.\n",
      "Subdued core sector data further affected market in Wednesday’s trade. A government data post Monday’s trading session showed that growth of eight infrastructure sectors slowed down to 4.2 per cent in August on account of decline in production of crude oil and fertiliser. The core sectors had expanded by 7.3 per cent in July 2018.\n",
      "Mustafa Nadeem, CEO, Epic Research said, “Volatility continues to expand as Nifty pares its previous gain to end at 10,858, its lowest level in recent fall from 11,750 levels. Continuous rise in the oil prices with brent hitting $85 mark rose some eyebrows and worries. Crude was above $75 mark and worries over CAD and its impact of widening. Rupee depreciated to multi-year lows as it hit above 73 marks was, on the other hand, fuelled the sentiment.”\n",
